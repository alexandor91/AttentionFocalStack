### :pencil: Configure ```config.json```

Please refer to our [config wiki](https://github.com/antocad/FocusOnDepth/wiki/Config-Wiki) to understand how to modify the config file to run a training.

### :nut_and_bolt: Run the training script
After that, you can simply run the training script: ```python train.py```
